The Guess the Number Game is a simple Java console application where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. In each round, a new number is generated, and players have up to 10 attempts to guess the correct number. The game allows for multiple rounds, adding to the fun and engagement. A scoring system is also implemented, where points are awarded based on the number of attempts taken. This project effectively demonstrates basic Java programming concepts while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.
